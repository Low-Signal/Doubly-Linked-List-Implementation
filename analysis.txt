/* Note that times for the first execution of each

Execution times for the reverse function:

Input Size 100 execution times:
Time One = 37 usec
Time Two = 27 usec
Time Three = 29 usec
Average Time = 31 usec

Input Size 1000 execution times:
Time One = 302 usec
Time Two = 253 usec
Time Three = 266 usec
Average Time = 273 usec

Input Size 10000 execution times:
Time One = 2913 usec
Time Two = 2306 usec
Time Three = 2305 usec
Average Time = 2508 usec

Reverse function Big-O complexity = O(N)



Execution time for the deduplicate function:

Input Size 100 execution times:
Time One = 166 usec
Time Two = 159 usec
Time Three = 160 usec
Average Time = 161 usec

Input Size 1000 execution times:
Time One = 13170 usec
Time Two = 12104 usec
Time Three = 11224 usec
Average Time = 12166 usec

Input Size 10000 execution times:
Time One = 736181 usec
Time Two = 664657 usec
Time Three = 648285 usec
Average Time = 683041 usec

Deduplicate function Big-O complexity = O(n^2)
